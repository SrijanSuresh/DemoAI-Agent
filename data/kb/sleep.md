# Sleep Hygiene
- Keep a consistent sleep and wake time.
- Wind down with a 20–30 min routine (dim lights, light reading, breathing).
- Keep the bedroom cool, dark, and quiet; reserve bed for sleep.
- Limit caffeine 6+ hours before bed; avoid screens in the last hour.
- If you can’t sleep in ~20 minutes, get up for a quiet activity until sleepy.
